The modules in this directory contain the core functionality for the punctuation prediction.

- All feature functions should be defined in `ffs.py`.
- Any functions associated with data parsing/processing should be in `dataproc.py`.
- The learning algorithms have their own modules, for example `collins.py`.
- The user should interact with all of this via the "shell" module `punctuator.py`.
